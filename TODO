0. Write documentation.

1. Fix the resource suitability test in the JobUtilities. Currently doesn't check for all the attributes. Also, some 
heuristics can be added for the properties that cannot be directly taken from the LDAP (say, disk space - 
it can change by the time the job actualy starts running). (DONE - changed to Matcher interface + Impl.)

2. Extract connection and LDAP operation timeouts to the API (?).

3. Add log4j.property file :)
